Utilization rates too high can signify an increased likelihood of no bikes being avaialble for potential riders. On the other hand, utilization rates too low can signify an increased likelihood of no docks being available, meaning riders would have to venture elsewhere to end their trip. Both of the above can cause frustrating user experiences and ultimately result in lost or unrealized future trips. "

    "Based on the above report, we have a few recommendations for Ford GoBike which we believe will increase ridership in the San Francisco area. There are two primary ways to increase ridership: increase the general public's interest in taking one-time trips (often joy rides) and to convert customers into subscribers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our research, we recommend offering discounts to customers who pick up and return their bikes at the same station. This will serve to promote \"joy rides\" around the city for visitors and others who have no interest in becoming subscribers. Given the nature of customer trips, we believe that a large majority of these are taken by travellers. Visitors to San Francisco tend to travel with others so we could offer quantity discounts for groups to entice them into biking around the city rather than walking, Segwaying, or taking the hop-on / hop-off tour buses. \n",
    "\n",
    "A different approach would be to add a couple docks to the stations with utilization rates higher than 55%. The goal here would be the optimize the user experience by reducing the chance that a station will either have no bikes to use or no docks available to return a bike in. Given our research, we recommend adding a couple of docks to stations 50, 70, 36, and 54. \n",

    "Lastly, we recommend increasing our marketing and advertising in the following zip codes: 94107, 94105, 94103, 94102, 94109, 95112, 94133, and 94111. These areas account for a good portion of our customers. By offering discounts or kickbacks in this area, we can likely convert some of our customers into full-time subscribers and recruit new riders through network effects."
